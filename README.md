orgpmp2
===================================================
orgpmp2 is a OpenRAVE plugin for GPMP2 (Gaussian Process Motion Planner 2) algorithm described in Motion Planning as Probabilistic Inference using Gaussian Processes and Factor Graphs (RSS 2016). Examples provided for WAM arm and PR2 use python scripts.

orgpmp2 is being developed by [Mustafa Mukadam](mailto:mmukadam3@gatech.edu) and [Jing Dong](mailto:thu.dongjing@gmail.com) as part of their work at Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab and is a modified version of [CHOMP openrave plugin](https://github.com/personalrobotics/or_cdchomp).

Compilation & Installation
------

- Install [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu). We have tested ROS indigo.
- Install [OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/). If you have trouble compiling the original version, please check out and install [our fork](https://github.com/gtrll/openrave) which has fixed few minor bugs.
- Install [GPMP2](https://github.com/gtrll/gpmp2) core C++ library.
- Install a few addtional dependencies

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gfortran libgsl0-dev python-enum
    ```
    
- Initialize a catkin workspace (if you use a existing catkin workspace this step is not needed)

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/gpmp2_catkin_ws/src
    cd gpmp2_catkin_ws/src
    catkin_init_workspace
    ```
    
- Add orgpmp2, [PrPy](https://github.com/personalrobotics/prpy) (python library for OpenRAVE),  [openrave_catkin](https://github.com/personalrobotics/openrave_catkin) (utility package for OpenRAVE) to ```gpmp2_catkin_ws/src```
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gtrll/orgpmp2.git
    git clone https://github.com/personalrobotics/openrave_catkin.git
    git clone https://github.com/personalrobotics/prpy.git
    ```
    
- Compile the catkin workspace
    
    ```bash
    catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```
    
- Before running the examples, the last step is setup the environment variables
    
    ```bash
    source ~/gpmp2_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    ```
